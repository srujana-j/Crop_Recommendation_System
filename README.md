 # Crop Recommendation System
A crop recommendation system uses machine learning to help farmers select the best crops by analyzing factors like soil type, moisture, weather, temperature, and historical yield data. It recommends crops suited to specific regions, optimizing productivity and sustainability.
# Features
- Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict the most suitable crops based on input parameters.

- High Accuracy: Achieves 99.39% accuracy with the Random Forest Classifier, ensuring reliable recommendations.

- User-Friendly Interface: Implements a web interface using Flask, allowing farmers to easily input their agricultural data and receive instant crop recommendations.

# Tech Stack
- Python: Primary programming language for data analysis, model development, and web application scripting.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building and evaluating predictive models using algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN.
- Flask: Micro-framework for web application development, enabling rapid deployment and scalability.
- Pandas and NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computation libraries in Python.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization tools for displaying data distributions and model performance metrics.

# Installation
Clone the repository:


```
